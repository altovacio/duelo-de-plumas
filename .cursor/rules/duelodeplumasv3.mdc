-Read [project_description.md](mdc:docs/project_description.md) and [tree.md](mdc:docs/tree.md) before anything.
-Read and keep [front_implementation_plan.md](mdc:docs/front_implementation_plan.md) updated
-The endpoints available are in [api_endpoints_programmatically.md](mdc:docs/api_endpoints_programmatically.md)
-Avoid generating new endpoints in the backend. First look for the working ones and already implemented. But if you must change the backend, do it.
-remember, we use docker
-You cannot see, read or list the .env file, but it exist. If you need info from this file, ask the user.
-You already have permission to read any other file, dont ask for it. If you need to read a file, just read it.
