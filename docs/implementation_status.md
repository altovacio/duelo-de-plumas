# Duelo de Plumas - Implementation Status

## Current Progress

The following is a comparison between the planned structure (from project_structure.md) and the current implementation status:

### Backend Implementation

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Core Structure** | ✅ | Basic FastAPI application structure implemented |
| **Auth System** | ✅ | JWT authentication implemented |
| **Database Setup** | ✅ | SQLAlchemy with migrations configured |
| **User Management** | ✅ | User model, routes, repository and service implemented. Added `GET /users/me` endpoint. |
| **Text Management** | ✅ | Text model, routes, repository and service implemented |
| **Contest Management** | ✅ | Contest model, routes, repository and service implemented. Renamed internal 'state' field to 'status' for consistency with tests and common usage. |
| **Voting System** | ✅ | Vote model, routes, repository and service implemented with enhanced multi-vote capabilities |
| **AI Agent System** | ✅ | Agent models, routes, repository and service implemented. API endpoint for agents corrected to `/agents` (from `/agents/agents`). Repository and service methods progressively being updated to full async/await. `execute_writer` endpoint now correctly returns `AgentExecutionResponse`. |
| **Credit System** | ✅ | Credit transaction tracking, admin management implemented. Actual cost calculation centralized in `utils.ai_models.estimate_credits`. |
| **Dashboard** | ✅ | Basic dashboard with credit information implemented |
| **Admin Features** | ✅ | Admin routes for user and credit management implemented |
| **Tests** | 🚧 | E2E tests: Sections 1-4 are now passing after significant async/await and endpoint corrections. Continuing to fix subsequent sections. Database interactions in services/repositories are being progressively converted to async. |
| **Agent Execution** | ✅ | Tracks AI agent executions |

## E2E Tests
- Monolithic E2E test file (`backend/tests/end_to_end_test.py`) has been refactored.
- E2E tests are now split into multiple files per section (e.g., `backend/tests/e2e_sec_01_setup_user_registration.py`, etc.) for better organization.
- NEW: A `debug_tests` directory (`backend/tests/debug_tests`) has been added for simpler, isolated test cases to help in debugging core functionalities.
- Shared state is managed in `backend/tests/shared_test_state.py`.
- Common fixtures and helpers are in `backend/tests/conftest.py`.
- The main test plan docstring is now in `backend/tests/e2e_test_plan_config.py`.
- All import errors within individual test files (`e2e_sec_*.py`) have been resolved.
- Deviation Note: Pre-execution credit estimation (`AIService.estimate_cost`) uses a simplified total token count rather than separate input/output estimates required by the core `estimate_credits` function. This might lead to inaccuracies in the pre-check but does not affect the final credit deduction, which uses the correct logic.

| Section | Description | Status | Deviations from Plan |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Setup & User Registration | Initial users and tokens | ✅ | Minor procedural difference in user ID retrieval (obtained at creation). |
| 1.01 | Admin logs in | ✅ |  |
| 1.02 | User 1 registers | ✅ |  |
| 1.03 | Obtain user1_token | ✅ |  |
| 1.04 | Admin registers User 2 | ✅ |  |
| 1.05 | User 2 logs in | ✅ |  |
| 1.06 | Admin verifies users | ✅ |  |
| 2. AI Agent Creation | Creating AI writers and judges | ✅ | API for listing agents (`GET /agents`) is more granular (owned vs. public via `?public=true`) than implied by some test plan phrasing. Tests were updated to reflect API. Admin listing of "all four" agents (2.07) via `GET /agents?public=true` only shows the public ones as per API. |

| 2.03 | Admin creates global AI Writer (writer_global) | ✅ |  |
| 2.04 | Admin creates global AI Judge (judge_global) | ✅ |  |
| 2.05 | User 1 lists their AI agents | ✅ | Test now correctly expects only owned agents, as per API. |
| 2.06 | User 2 lists their AI agents | ✅ | Test now calls `GET /agents?public=true` to correctly verify listing public agents. |
| 2.07 | Admin lists global AI agents | ✅ | Test now correctly verifies `GET /agents?public=true` lists public agents. |
