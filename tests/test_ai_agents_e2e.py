def test_ai_agent_user_admin_workflow():
    """Runs an end-to-end workflow test for User-Owned AI Agents.

    Covers CRUD operations for AI Writers and Judges by their owners,
    checks access restrictions between users, and verifies admin capabilities
    including modification and deletion of user agents, and cascading deletes upon user removal.

    **Assumptions:**
    - User-specific endpoints like `/users/me/ai-writers`, `/users/me/ai-judges` exist for CRUD.
    - Admin endpoints `/admin/ai-writers`, `/admin/ai-judges` exist for listing, viewing, updating, and deleting ANY agent.
    - Deleting a user via `/admin/users/{user_id}` cascades and deletes all associated agents, contests, submissions, etc.
    - AI Action Request/Approval endpoints are currently out of scope ([ ] in spec).

    **Steps:**

    --- Setup ---
    1.  Register User 1 (`ai_user1`)
    2.  Login User 1 & Get ID
    3.  Register User 2 (`ai_user2`)
    4.  Login User 2 & Get ID
    5.  Login Admin
